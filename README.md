# Static Site Automation

### What it is?
This Gihub action that uses the [golang aws sdk](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) to build s3 bucket and attach policy
for static website deploy the static file to that newly created s3 bucket and
comment the url to the PR. To deploy static file it uses either from your
repository or build during your workflow. There is [self hosted](https://github.com/razzkumar/frontend-PR-automation) tool, if Github
action is not feasible.


### Best for?
   - Immediate feedback visually to developers or anyone interested in changes.
   - Reduce burden of having to build application for QA and verify the changes.
   - Faster iterations.

### How to use?

Add `.yml` file/s such as given examples in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

##### The following example will:
   - Create s3 bucket and attach policy for static site
   - Build the javascript/typescript frontend application with the help of
     given command (ex: `BUILD_COMMAND="yarn build"`)
   - Upload build file (static site) to s3
   - Comment the URL of the static site to the Pull Request
   - Delete the aws S3 bucket after PR is merged

##### Config file: `.github/workflows/deploy-existing.yml`

```yaml
name: Next js frontend dev

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - dev

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Build and deploy Studio app
      uses: razzkumar/pr-automation-with-s3@v1.0.2
      env:
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }} 
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
        SRC_FOLDER: "out"
        ACTION: 'deploy'
        BUILD_COMMAND: "yarn build && yarn export"
        CLOUDFRONT_ID: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFRONT_ID }}
        SECRETS_MANAGER: ${{ secrets.SECRETS_MANAGER }} // name of secrets on secret manager
```


##### Config file: `.github/workflows/deploy-on-pr.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy site to S3 And add comment to PR and delete after merge

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Static site deploy to s3 and comment on PR
      uses: razzkumar/pr-automation-with-s3@v1.0.2
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        GH_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_ACCESS_TOKEN}}
        AWS_REGION: 'us-east-2'     # optional: defaults to us-east-2
        SRC_FOLDER: 'build'         # optional: defaults to build (react app)
        IS_BUILD: 'true'            # optional: defaults to true
        ACTION: "create"            # optional: defaults to create (option:create,delete and deploy)
        BUILD_COMMAND: "yarn build" # optional: defaults to `yarn build`
```


##### Config file: `.github/workflows/cleanup-on-pr-merge.yml`

```yaml
name: Delete S3 bucket after PR merge

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  delete:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Clean up temperory bucket
      if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
      uses: razzkumar/pr-automation-with-s3@v1.0.2
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: 'us-east-2'     # optional: defaults to us-east-2
        ACTION: "delete"            # Action must be delete to delete

```

- It can be used for many other purpose also,some of the [examples](https://github.com/razzkumar/pr-automation-with-s3/blob/master/examples/deploy-pre-build-site.yml) are:
  - Deploy prebuild app [config link](https://github.com/razzkumar/pr-automation-with-s3/blob/master/examples)
  - Build react app and deploy it. [config link](https://github.com/razzkumar/pr-automation-with-s3/blob/master/examples/build-and-deploy-react-app.yml)

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `GH_ACCESS_TOKEN`,`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.

#### Note for S3 Bucket creation
 - It only create a s3 bucket if not `exist`
 - While Creating bucket for the pull_request S3 bucket name will be: `PR-Branch`.pr`PR-number`.auto-deploy
    - For Eg.:
      - if  base branch is `SIG-1000` and PR number is `23` the the bucket name will be `sig-100.pr23.auto-deploy`
 - If we deploy app on push or (not on pull requst) like prebuild app deployment, app build and deploy then the bucket name will be `$AWS_S3_BUCKET.auto-deploy`
    - For Eg.
      - if `AWS_S3_BUCKET=dev-test-deployment` then bucket will be `dev-test-deployment.auto-deploy`
